# RapiAuth: Multi-Tenant Identity Service

## Introduction:

Welcome to the repository of the RapiAuth project, a Multi-Tenant identity service designed to simplify authentication in shared environments. This project focuses on providing a comprehensive solution for managing users, roles, and permissions, allowing developers to easily integrate authentication into their applications.

## Project Objective:

The main objective of RapiAuth is to develop a Multi-Tenant identity service that not only allows users to manage their own 'tenants' but also provides a user-friendly interface and API for the seamless integration of authentication into external applications.

### Key Features:

1. User Registration:
   - Users can register by providing necessary information.
   - Option to create their own 'tenant' during the registration process.
2. Tenant Management:
   - Creation and configuration of 'tenants' by users.
   - Joining existing 'tenants' through invitations.
3. Role Assignment:
   - Each 'tenant' can have multiple roles defining responsibilities and permissions.
   - A user can have different roles in different 'tenants'.
4. Specific Permissions:
   - Roles composed of specific permissions determining allowed actions.
   - Permission definition by 'tenant' owners or administrators.
5. Roles and Permissions Administration:
   - 'Tenant' owners and administrators can create, modify, and delete roles.
   - Assignment and revocation of permissions as per 'tenant' needs.
6. Developer API:
   - Well-documented and easy-to-use API for developers to integrate authentication.
   - Customization of the login interface to seamlessly integrate with external applications.

# Key Design Principles:

1. Security:
   - Implementation of robust measures to protect information and ensure data integrity.
2. Scalability:
   - System design to handle growth in users and 'tenants'.
3. Flexibility:
   - Flexible assignment of roles and permissions to adapt to various organizational structures.
4. Intuitive User Interface:
   - Development of an easy-to-use interface for registration and management of 'tenants', roles, and permissions.
5. Activity Logging:
   - Detailed logging of changes in roles or permissions for auditability.
6. Ease of Integration:
   - Clear and accessible API design for seamless integration into external applications.
   - Detailed documentation and code examples for external developers.
